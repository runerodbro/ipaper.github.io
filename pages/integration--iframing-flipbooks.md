	<b>Important:</b>

	While it is possible to do, we generally do not recommend iframing catalogs unless you have a specific reason for doing so.
	<ul>
		<li>As visitors come from a multitude of devices, including tablets, phones & desktop computers, you'll have to handle the different screen sizes yourself.</li>
		<li>Tablets & phones have special requirements to ensure they work when users rotate their device.</li>
		<li>The smaller the catalog is, the harder it is for users to read it. By opening up catalogs in a new window, rather than in an iframe, you ensure the users get the best possible reading experience.</li>
	</ul>

	This being said, if you want or need to iframe the Flipbook, please make sure to read & understand the following guide carefully.
</div>

## Foreword

When using iframes on mobile devices it can be tricky trying to make it respond as expected. Below we show you how to make Flipbooks behave optimally.

{% include important.html content="
	It's important that you follow our directions below precisely. There are many devices and what may work for you in testing will fail for users in production. If you manage to get something working that isn't described here, do tell us so we can verify the 	solution. Anything but the below is to be considered unsupported and may fail either nor or in the future.
"%}

## Requirements

* A working Custom Domain module. Specifically, the actual Flipbook needs to be on a subdomain to the domain on which the iframe is placed.

## iFraming Flipbooks in 100x100% Size

{% include note.html content="This is supported on all platforms and is the recommended way of iframing catalogs."%}

In order to iframe a iPaper catalog, spanning 100% of page, we need to use a specific setup. The markup below shows the essence of what is needed. Firstly, if we set an iframe to have the width & height of 100% we must place this inside a div. Having done this we need to do the following:
* Doctype must be ```<!DOCTYPE html>```
* Set the wrapper ```<div>``` width & height to 100%.
* Set the wrapper ```<div>``` overflow to hidden.
* Set ```<body>``` & ```<html>``` height to 100%.
* Include the ```<meta>``` tag presented below.
* Include the ```<script>``` tag presented below, setting the document.domain to the root domain used.

{% include important.html content="The steps listed above must be ready on load. It will NOT work if you manipulate the dom client-side"%}

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="height: 100%">
  <head>
    <title>Catalogues</title>
    <style type="text/css">
        * { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
    </style>
    <script type="text/javascript">document.domain = 'ipapercms.dk';</script>
    <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, width=device-width" />
  </head>
    <body style="height: 100%">
        <div style="height: 100%; width: 100%; overflow: hidden">
            <iframe src="http://test.ipapercms.dk/Releases/Mobile/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%; height: 100%"></iframe>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Framing Flipbooks in non-100x100% Size

{% include important.html content="This is only supported for the <b>iPad</b> and <b>Desktop</b> platforms. On all other platforms it is unsupported. While you may get it to work, expect it to break on certain devices and later on when we change the system."%}

For these platforms you can specify width in any size you want, even in percentages. Do take care to leave enough space for the user to have a usable experience however. To set the size, you need to change the dimensions on the outer div like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="height: 100%">
  <head>
    <title>Catalogues</title>
    <style type="text/css">
        * { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
    </style>
    <script type="text/javascript">document.domain = 'ipapercms.dk';</script>
    <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, width=device-width" />
  </head>
    <body style="height: 100%">
        <div style="height: 300px; width: 600px; overflow: hidden">
            <iframe src="http://test.ipapercms.dk/Releases/Mobile/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 100%; height: 100%"></iframe>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Dynamically Resizing
Dynamically resizing the div will work. Do make sure you resize the outer and not the iframe.

### Removing the iPaper User Interface
To remove the iPaper userinterface, look under the "Basic Settings" tab when editing the settings for an iPaper. All JavaScript events will still be fired, even without the user interface present.

{% include note.html content="Removing the standard user interface is only supported in HTML iPapers."%}
