## General Guidelines

* If an API returns a humanly read message, do not rely on it. It may change over time without notification. The message is only intended to help you understand the return code.
* Anything but a SUCCESS return code should be treated as an error. An ERROR return code may be changed with a more specific return code at a later stage, but a SUCCESS code will never be changed without previous notification.
* Any breaking changes will either be notified in due time, or a new API version will be setup so the old one can run concurrently.
* API methods may be appended without there being created a new overall API version, but only as long as they add non-breaking features like optional fields and extra return data. As a result of this, do use XPATH to query results, you should not rely on element index positions.
