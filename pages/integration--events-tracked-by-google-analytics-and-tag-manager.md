title: Events tracked by Google Analytics / Tag Manager

## Google Analytics
We only track **Pageview** (both initial load and if enduser pages the flipbook) in Google Analytics.

## Google Tag Manager
We track **PageElementClicked** for linktypes **internal** & **external**.

The following features have also been enabled for GTM:

```
['ua', 'ga', 'v', 'e', 'u', 'c', 'img', 'adm', 'awct', 'sp', 'gcs', 'ctv', 'f', 'smm', 'r']
```

You can find more information about what they entail on this page:
